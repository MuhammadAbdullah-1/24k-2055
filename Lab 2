ALGORITHM
Task 1:
Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth number is a divisor of an nth Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6). 
If so, determine if it’s an even number or odd number as well.

1.	User entered Nth number as aN.
2.	User entered nth number as an.
3.	If (an mod aN = 0) then Display aN is a divisor of an.
4.	Else Display aN is not a divisor of an.
5.	Then set Quotient as (an/aN).
6.	If (Quotient mod 2 = 0) then Display Quotient is Even.
7.	Else Display Quotient is Odd.

Task 3:
Implement an algorithm for making a simple calculator with all the operators (+, -, *, /, %).
Intro: Below is a calculator to add, subtract, multiply, divide or to find the percentage of any two numbers.

1.	Ask the user to Enter First number.
2.	Ask the user to Enter Second number.
3.	Set Sum to (First number + Second Number).
4.	Set Difference to (First number - Second Number).
5.	Set Product to (First number * Second Number).
6.	Set Quotient to (First number / Second Number).
7.	Set Percentage to (First number % Second Number).
8.	Ask the user to Find What (Sum, Difference, Product, Quotient, Percentage).
9.	Display what the user enters in Find What.


PSEUDOCODE
Task 2:
Take three variables as input and add them without using the + operator
(Use your head for this)

1.	Start
2.	Input Number 1
3.	Input Number 2 
4.	Input number 3
5.	Set Sum to 0.
6.	Set Sum to {(-Number 1 - Number 2 - Number 3) x (- 1)}
7.	Print Sum
8.	End

Task 3:
Create a small calculator which only does ‘+’ or ‘- ‘Operations. 
(Hint: Take three variable inputs with one being used for the operator)

1.	Start
2.	Input Number 1
3.	Input ‘+’ or ‘-‘ Operator
4.	Input Number 2 
5.	Set Result to 0.
6.	Set Result to {(Number 1) (Operator) (Number 2)}
7.	Print Result
8.	End
